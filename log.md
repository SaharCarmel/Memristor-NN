#### Meeting summary
#### Work log
#### Tasks
- [ ] Reference MNIST network
- [ ] yaml config
- [ ] data loading
- [ ] simulation logs
  - [ ] date
  - [ ] architecture
  - [ ] yaml file
  - [ ] time for convergence
  - [ ] hardware
  - [ ] plots
  - [ ] acuuracy
  - [ ] over fitting
#### Questions
- [ ] Should we implement multi-layer modules? If so, should we implement activation layers?
